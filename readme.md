# Opponent Style Representation Learning Method Based on Spatio-Temporal Features

## üìú Project Overview
- A novel adversarial style modeling framework based on spatiotemporal features
- Automated feature extraction, dynamic style recognition
- Game AI, strategic decision-making systems

## üåü Key Features
- üîç **Spatiotemporal Feature Fusion**: Dual-channel feature extraction combining rule-based and deep learning approaches
- üöÄ **High-Accuracy Modeling**: Achieves >97% recognition accuracy in experimental environments
- ‚ö° **Lightweight Architecture**: Efficient feature processing with PyFeatNet
- üìä **Visual Analytics**: Optional built-in module for style comparison visualization

## üìä Dataset Description
The experimental dataset (Dataset.zip) contains game logs of opponent style interactions, which are used for model training and validation. The dataset includes:
- Multiple categories of opponent style samples (e.g., aggressive, defensive, balanced)
- Spatiotemporal feature records of game states at 100ms intervals
- Annotation files for style classification labels

Due to repository storage limitations and network transmission considerations, the uploaded dataset is a subset: each style category contains 15 representative game logs. In actual research and application scenarios, the complete dataset includes 1000 games per style, with a total size of 103.6GB.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
**Experimental Environment**: This research utilizes the [MicroRTS-Py](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/MicroRTS-Py/) environment for algorithm validation and performance testing.

**Data Sources**: Experimental data combines:
1. Logs from the [gym-microrts-paper](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/gym-microrts-paper) benchmark suite
2. Built-in agent logs from the MicroRTS platform

### Generate Log Data (using selected agents)
1. The following three files are logs generated by running selected intelligent agents:
   - 1model_vs_model.py
   - 2model_vs_model.py
   - 3odel_vs_model.py
2. datatool1 is a data processing tool. After generating the log data, it can be run.
3. The three train_merged files are trained models.
