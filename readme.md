# Opponent Style Representation Learning Method Based on Spatio-Temporal Features



## üìú Project Overview


- A novel adversarial style modeling framework based on spatiotemporal features
- Automated feature extraction, dynamic style recognition
- Game AI, strategic decision-making systems



## üåü Key Features

- üîç **Spatiotemporal Feature Fusion**: Dual-channel feature extraction combining rule-based and deep learning approaches
- üöÄ **High-Accuracy Modeling**: Achieves >97% recognition accuracy in experimental environments
- ‚ö° **Lightweight Architecture**: Efficient feature processing with PyFeatNet
- üìä **Visual Analytics**: Optional built-in module for style comparison visualization

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Experimental Environment**: This research utilizes the [MicroRTS-Py](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/MicroRTS-Py/) environment for algorithm validation and performance testing.
 
**Data Sources**: Experimental data combines:
1. Logs from the [gym-microrts-paper](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/gym-microrts-paper) benchmark suite
2. Built-in agent logs from the MicroRTS platform

Generate Log Data (using selected agents):

1. The following three files are logs generated by running selected intelligent agents:<br/>   
1model_vs_model.py</br>
2model_vs_model.py</br>
3odel_vs_model.py

2. datatool1 is a data processing tool. After generating the log data, it can be run.
3. The three train_merged files are trained models.
